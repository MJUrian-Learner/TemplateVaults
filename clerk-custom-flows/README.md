# Clerk Custom Flows

A custom-built authentication flow using Clerk and Next.js, designed for developers who want full control over the user experience and logic, beyond what Clerk's prebuilt components offer.

---

## ðŸ§  Why Use Custom Flows?

This folder exists for developers who want to:

1. **Gain total control** over the entire authentication flow â€” from sign-in to session handling.
2. **Remove abstraction** provided by Clerkâ€™s default UI components.
3. **Eliminate Clerk branding** for a fully white-labeled user experience.
4. **Avoid relying on Clerk Elements** which are still in beta and may lack long-term stability.
5. **Learn and understand Clerkâ€™s low-level primitives**, improving your knowledge of authentication systems.

## ðŸ“¦ Whatâ€™s Included

* Custom Sign In / Sign Up pages
* Email/password authentication using Clerkâ€™s backend primitives
* Magic link and passwordless flow support (optional)
* Session management with Clerk SDK
* Reusable components with Tailwind styling

---

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

1. Copy the folder into your Next.js project:

   ```bash
   cp -r clerk-custom-flows ./my-app
   ```

2. Update your environment variables:

   ```env
   NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=
   CLERK_SECRET_KEY=
   NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_FRONTEND_API=
   NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_IN_URL=/sign-in
   NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_UP_URL=/sign-up
   ```

3. Customize the UI to match your branding and layout.

4. Use Clerk's server and client SDKs to handle sign-in, sign-up, and session validation manually.

## ðŸ“Œ Notes

* This template assumes a working knowledge of Clerkâ€™s API-based authentication.
* Ideal for SaaS apps, internal tools, and white-label products.
